# Needed That Data API

API services to get venezuelan data that I needed (or not) from official providers. For example, USD rates from BCV or person information based on their ID ("cedula") from CNE.

Made with Express.js and typescript

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

# or

yarn
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the info from `.env.example`.

```bash
# Windows
copy .env.example .env

# Linux
cp .env.example .env
```

Then build the JS files and run the server by doing

```bash
npm run build
npm run start

# or

yarn build
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

### Watch mode for development
You can also use the watch mode by running:

```bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```

  

This will build the JS files, start the TS watch compilation mode and then run the server.

  

Any change in a TS file will be automatically build into JS files
